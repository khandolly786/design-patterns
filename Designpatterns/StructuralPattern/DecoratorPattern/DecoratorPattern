1️⃣ Definition

Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows us to add new behavior or responsibilities to an object dynamically (at runtime) without modifying its original class.

👉 It follows the principle:
“Open for extension, Closed for modification.”

2️⃣ Why Decorator Pattern Came

Decorator Pattern came to solve problems caused by:

Too many subclasses

Feature explosion

Rigid inheritance hierarchy

Need to add features dynamically

❌ Problem without Decorator

If we use inheritance for every feature combination:

Coffee
 ├── CoffeeWithMilk
 ├── CoffeeWithSugar
 ├── CoffeeWithMilkAndSugar
 ├── CoffeeWithCream
 ├── CoffeeWithMilkSugarCream


😵 Too many classes → Class explosion

3️⃣ What Problem Decorator Solves

Avoids subclass explosion

Adds functionality without touching existing code

Allows mix & match of features

Supports runtime behavior change

4️⃣ When to Use Decorator Pattern

Use Decorator Pattern when:

You want to add optional features

You don’t want to modify existing classes

Inheritance leads to too many subclasses

Behavior should be added at runtime

You want flexible combinations of features

5️⃣ When NOT to Use Decorator Pattern

Avoid Decorator when:

Object is very simple

No dynamic behavior is required

Too many decorators make debugging hard

6️⃣ Key Components of Decorator Pattern
🔹 1. Component (Interface / Abstract Class)

Defines the base behavior.

🔹 2. Concrete Component

Original object whose behavior we want to extend.

🔹 3. Decorator (Abstract)

Implements the same interface and wraps the component.

🔹 4. Concrete Decorator

Adds extra behavior before or after delegating to the wrapped object.

7️⃣ Structure (Logical Flow)

Decorator has-a component (composition), not is-a subclass (inheritance).

8️⃣ Simple Real-Life Analogy (Non-Food)
🎮 Video Game Character

Base character → can run

Add armor → extra protection

Add weapon → extra attack

Add shield → extra defense

👉 You wrap character with abilities
👉 Same character, different powers
👉 Added dynamically

This is Decorator Pattern.

9️⃣ Simple Python Example
# Component
class Notifier:
    def send(self, message):
        pass


# Concrete Component
class EmailNotifier(Notifier):
    def send(self, message):
        return f"Email sent: {message}"


# Decorator
class NotifierDecorator(Notifier):
    def __init__(self, notifier):
        self.notifier = notifier


# Concrete Decorators
class SMSDecorator(NotifierDecorator):
    def send(self, message):
        return self.notifier.send(message) + " | SMS sent"


class WhatsAppDecorator(NotifierDecorator):
    def send(self, message):
        return self.notifier.send(message) + " | WhatsApp sent"

Usage
notifier = EmailNotifier()
notifier = SMSDecorator(notifier)
notifier = WhatsAppDecorator(notifier)

print(notifier.send("Hello"))

Output
Email sent: Hello | SMS sent | WhatsApp sent

🔁 What Happened Here?

Email → base behavior

SMS → added without modifying Email class

WhatsApp → added dynamically

Same object, extended behavior

10️⃣ Decorator vs Inheritance
Decorator	Inheritance
Runtime behavior	Compile-time behavior
Flexible	Rigid
Avoids class explosion	Causes class explosion
Uses composition	Uses inheritance
11️⃣ Decorator vs Adapter (Very Important)
Decorator	Adapter
Adds new behavior	Converts interface
Same interface	Different interface
Enhances object	Makes incompatible classes work
12️⃣ SOLID Principles Followed

✅ Open-Closed Principle

✅ Single Responsibility Principle

✅ Composition over Inheritance

13️⃣ Advantages

Flexible and extensible

No modification of existing code

Dynamic behavior addition

Cleaner than inheritance

14️⃣ Disadvantages

Many small classes

Harder debugging if overused

Order of decorators may matter

15️⃣ Interview One-Liners

Definition

“Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added dynamically to an object without modifying its class.”

Use case

“Used when inheritance causes class explosion.”

Key idea

“Wrap objects instead of subclassing.”

16️⃣ Memory Trick 🧠

🧠 Decorator = Gift wrapping 🎁
Same gift, extra layers, more features.

17️⃣ Very Short Exam Answer (4–5 lines)

Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern used to add new responsibilities to an object dynamically. It avoids subclass explosion and follows the Open-Closed Principle. It uses composition instead of inheritance. Decorators wrap objects and enhance their behavior at runtime.
