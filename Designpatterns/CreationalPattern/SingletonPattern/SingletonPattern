1️⃣ Definition

Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern in which a proxy object acts as a substitute or placeholder for a real object to control access to it.

👉 The proxy and the real object share the same interface,
so the client cannot tell the difference between them.

2️⃣ Why Proxy Pattern Came

Proxy pattern exists to solve problems like:

Expensive object creation

Heavy resources usage

Security control needed

Remote access

Lazy loading

Access restrictions

3️⃣ Core Idea (Simple Line)

Client talks to Proxy,
Proxy talks to Real Object.

4️⃣ Types of Proxy Pattern
🔹 1. Virtual Proxy

👉 Creates object only when needed
( Lazy loading )

🔹 2. Protection Proxy

👉 Controls access (security / permissions)

🔹 3. Remote Proxy

👉 Represents object in another system (network / API)

🔹 4. Caching Proxy

👉 Stores results to improve performance

🔹 5. Logging Proxy

👉 Logs access and operations

5️⃣ Problem Without Proxy
Client → Real Object


❌ Always heavy load
❌ No access control
❌ No caching
❌ No security
❌ No monitoring

6️⃣ Solution With Proxy
Client → Proxy → Real Object


✔ Access control
✔ Lazy loading
✔ Caching
✔ Security
✔ Performance optimization

7️⃣ Structure of Proxy Pattern
Components:

Subject (Interface)

Common interface for Proxy & RealObject

RealSubject

Actual object that does real work

Proxy

Controls access to RealSubject

Client

Uses Subject interface

8️⃣ Simple Python Example
# Subject Interface
class Image:
    def display(self):
        pass


# Real Subject
class RealImage(Image):
    def __init__(self, filename):
        print("Loading image from disk...")
        self.filename = filename

    def display(self):
        print(f"Displaying {self.filename}")


# Proxy
class ImageProxy(Image):
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
        self.real_image = None

    def display(self):
        if self.real_image is None:
            self.real_image = RealImage(self.filename)
        self.real_image.display()


# Client
img = ImageProxy("photo.png")
img.display()   # loads + displays
img.display()   # only displays (cached)

9️⃣ What Happened Here?

ImageProxy controls creation of RealImage

Real image is created only when needed

This is Virtual Proxy

🔁 Real-Life Analogy (Non-Food)
🏦 Bank Locker System

You cannot directly access the locker.

Process:

You → Bank Counter (Proxy) → Locker Room (Real Object)


The counter:

Checks identity

Controls access

Logs activity

Then allows access

👉 Counter = Proxy
👉 Locker = Real Object
👉 You = Client

10️⃣ Proxy vs Decorator vs Adapter (Important)
Pattern	Purpose
Proxy	Control access
Decorator	Add new behavior
Adapter	Convert interface
11️⃣ Advantages

Improves performance

Adds security

Enables lazy loading

Controls access

Supports logging & monitoring

Separation of concerns

12️⃣ Disadvantages

Extra layer of complexity

Slight performance overhead

More classes

13️⃣ When to Use Proxy Pattern

Use Proxy when:

Object creation is expensive

Access needs control

Object is remote

Caching is required

Security is required

14️⃣ When NOT to Use

Avoid Proxy when:

Object is lightweight

No access control needed

Simplicity is priority

15️⃣ SOLID Principles Followed

✅ Open-Closed Principle

✅ Single Responsibility Principle

✅ Dependency Inversion Principle

16️⃣ Interview One-Liners

Definition

“Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate object to control access to a real object.”

Use case

“Used for lazy loading, access control, caching, and security.”

Key idea

“Proxy controls access, Decorator adds behavior.”

17️⃣ Memory Trick 🧠

🧠 Proxy = Security Guard 🚨
You don’t go directly inside — guard checks first.

18️⃣ Very Short Exam Answer (4–5 lines)

Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern where a proxy object controls access to a real object. It is used for lazy loading, access control, caching, and security. The proxy and real object share the same interface. It improves performance and system security.
