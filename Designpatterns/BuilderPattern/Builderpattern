Builder Pattern
✅ Definition

Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used to create complex objects step by step.
It separates the construction process of an object from its final representation, so the same process can create different versions of the object.

❓ Why Builder Pattern comes

Builder pattern comes to solve problems caused by:

Constructors having too many parameters
constructor telescoping
mutable
inconsistent state problem
scattered validation

Many optional fields

Confusing parameter order

Multiple constructor overloads

👉 When object creation becomes messy and unreadable, Builder is needed.

⏰ When to use Builder Pattern

Use Builder Pattern when:

Object has many optional attributes

Object creation must be step by step

You want readable object creation

Same object can be built in different ways

Constructor overloading becomes hard to manage

🧠 How Builder Pattern solves the problem

Builder Pattern:

Removes large constructors

Builds object incrementally

Makes code clean and readable

Allows different configurations of the same object

Separates what is built from how it is built

👉 Client controls what features to add
👉 Builder controls how the object is created

🚗 Real-Life Example (Non-Food)
Car Customization

You go to a car showroom.

You don’t say:

“Give me a car with engine=true, ac=false, sunroof=true, gps=false…”

Instead, you say step by step:

Add engine

Add AC

Add music system

Each step adds a feature.

👉 Final car is built after all choices are made

This is exactly how Builder Pattern works.

🧩 Problem Without Builder
Car(engine, ac, sunroof, gps, airbags, color, music)


❌ Hard to read
❌ Order matters
❌ Optional values confusing

✅ With Builder
CarBuilder()
  .addEngine()
  .addAC()
  .addMusic()
  .build()


✔ Clear
✔ Flexible
✔ Maintainable
